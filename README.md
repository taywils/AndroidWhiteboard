Recommended Setup
-----------------

- **PLEASE DO NOT USE AN EMULATOR TO RUN THIS APPLICATION!**

1. Download Google Android Studio [https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
2. Once installed (or if you already have it installed) git clone this repo into a new directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/taywils/AndroidWhiteboard.git
```

3. Open Android Studio
4. Choose "Import Project"
5. Navigate to the folder where you cloned this repo and choose it
6. You will probably need to let Android Studio install the SDK 19 tools if you haven't
7. Android Studio is still in BETA so when it prompts you to install the SDK ignore it and watch the progress bar in the bottom right corner of the application
8. If everything went well you should be able to run the application
9. If you don't have multiple phones use the web client to simulate another user [http://warm-fortress-2906.herokuapp.com/](http://warm-fortress-2906.herokuapp.com/)
